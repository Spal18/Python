        "#I/O-Bound Tasks: Multithreading is ideal for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations, such as reading/writing files, network requests, or database queries. Since these tasks are often idle, multiple threads can run concurrently without significant performance hits.\n",
        "#Shared Memory: When tasks need to share data frequently, multithreading is beneficial because threads within the same process share the same memory space, making data sharing more efficient.\n",
        "#Lightweight Context Switching: Threads are lighter than processes, so switching between threads is faster and uses less memory. This is useful for applications that require frequent context switching.\n",
